			<h2 id="Lin2"> Who is Lin-Manuel Miranda? </h2>
			<p class="info"> Lin-Manuel Miranda, born in New York, January 16, 1980. He is born a Puerto Rican by his parents Luis Miranda and Luz Towns-Miranda. He grew up in Northern Manhattan with his political consultant father and psychologist mother. Lin, a nickname given to Lin-Manuel Miranda by his students, later saw his first musical, Les Miserables, at the age of seven, jump-starting his inspiration to become a musical genius. He grew up with show tunes and salsa and grew his interests of music through hip-hop and R&B, later becoming a rapper. During his high school days, Lin won the lead role in his school's drama program. He studied theatre as a course in Wesleyan University, along with studying, he began to compose songs and write lyrics, eventually starting the draft of "In The Heights," a musical that will begin Lin's road to fame. </p>
			<br>
			<p class="info">Graduating in 2002, Lin began his acting career, giving him roles and cameos in famous shows, all the while performing in a hip-hop improv group called Freestyle Love Supreme. 6 years later, his musical, "In the Heights" debuts in Broadway of March 2008, later winning four Tony Awards and a Grammy Award for best musical show album. A film adaptation of this musical was made 13 years later. After his famous musical of "In The Heights," Lin decided to begin a new musical, calling it "Hamilton." A musical about the American Founding Father and his entire life. Late in the year of 2015, "Hamilton" the musical released, awarding Lin the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and 11 Tony Awards. Lin made his final appearance on "Hamilton" on July of 16, leaving "Hamilton" to tour the world with different leads and theatres.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="info">Within the same year that Lin finished his "Hamilton" appearances, he began to compose and work with Disney on their songs, while making occasional appearances in movies like Mary Poppins Returns and His Dark Materials. He composed songs in Moana, earning his Academy Award nomination, then later composing more songs for Encanto. Lin later directed his first feature film of tick, tick... BOOM! in 2021, which was an adaptation of the stage musical. Then to top it all off, Lin wrote lyrics for The Little Mermaid.</p>
